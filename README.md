# Comparing samplers on MNIST

## Method

To compare the lift generated by samplers contained in imbalanced-learn, labels from the MNIST data set are grouped to create a binary classification task. One of the two binary classes is down-sampled to artificially generate a skewed training set. Samplers are applied to this training set and classifiers trained. The lift due to samplers is measured in typical classification scores, comparing against results of classifiers trained on data not modified by a sampler. 

The size of the training set prior to the samplers is also variied to test the influence the degree to which the space is sampled has on the lift produced by the samplers.

## Results

In this case of binarized groups of MNIST classes, the lift appears to depend on the size of the training set before sampling. While the lift is small for originally large training sets before sampling, the lift increases with decreasing size of the training set before sampling. 

## Note
sklearn == 0.21.3 required for imblearn 0.5.0 to work. It's easiest to create a new conda env from scratch with sklearn and imblearn.
