# Comparing samplers on MNIST

## Method
To compare the lift generated by samplers contained in imbalanced-learn, labels from the MNIST data set are grouped to create a binary classification task. One of the two binary classes is down-sampled to artificially generate a skewed training set. Samplers are applied to this training set and classifiers trained. The gain is measured in typical classification scores, comparing against results of classifiers with no sampling applied. The size of the training set prior to the samplers is also variied to test the influence the degree to which the space is sampled on the lift produced by the samplers.

## Results
In this case of binarized groups of MNIST classes, the gain appears to depend on the size of the training set before sampling, increasing with decreasing size of the training set before sampling.
